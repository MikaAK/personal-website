I like to break things, it tends to happen when trying out new technologies without doing much research. During the process of fixing things and reading docs, I love to ask questions in the related communities and figure out how I can be more efficient in what I'm coding.</p>

This blog will be an embodiment of the things Iâ€™ve learned and the experiences I've had hacking</p>
