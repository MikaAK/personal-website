        <p class="lh-copy">I’m sure you’ve guessed it if you’re reading this, I’m starting a blog. I like to break things, not usually on purpose but it tends to happen when trying out new technologies without doing much research. During the process of fixing things I love to ask questions in the related communities and figure out how I can do what I’m doing better.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy mt4">Often time, I’ve been lucky enough to talk with people who work on the source or even authored the library (big thanks to everyone who’ve answered all my dumb questions 🙌🙌), this blog will be an embodiment of the things I’ve learned from those talks and the experiences I've had hacking</p>
        <p class="lh-copy mt5">Look for things to come on:</p>
