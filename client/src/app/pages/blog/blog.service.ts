        <p class="lh-copy">Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve guessed it if youâ€™re reading this, Iâ€™m starting a new blog! I like to break things, it tends to happen when trying out new technologies without doing much research. During the process of fixing things and reading docs, I love to ask questions in the related communities and figure out how I can be more efficient in what I'm coding.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy mt4">Often, Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to talk to people who are working on the source, or even authored the library (big thanks to everyone whoâ€™ve answered all my dumb questions ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ). This blog will be an embodiment of the things Iâ€™ve learned and the experiences I've had hacking</p>
